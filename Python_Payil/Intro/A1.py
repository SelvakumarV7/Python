# Python is an interpreted High Level Language.
# Multi-Paradigm - OOP, Functional,Procedural
# Interpreted - Line by line execution.
    # Error findings are easy(Reworking process is low)
# Applications:
    # Web Application
    # Mobile Application
    # ML/DS/AI
    # Games
    # Network Programming

# Simple and easy to learn and implement.
# Platform Independent: used in Linux,Windows because it is virtual machine.
# Dynamically typed: data types are not mentioned in every place.(int,float,str,and so on.)
# identifiers otherwise known as Variables.
# DataTypes: 14
    # int
    # float
    # complex
    # boolean
    # string
    # byte
    # bytearray
    # range
    # set
    # tuple
    # list
    # dict
    # none
    # frozenset
# int:
    # Decimal Form
    # Binary Form
    # Octal Form
    # Hexadecimal Form
# Type Casting: Changing one Datatype into Another Datatype known as Casting.
# Fundamental Datatypes: int,float,bool,string,complex.
    # all fundamental datatypes are immutable in nature.(not changing datatype)
    # Immutability: if the value of two variables(identifier) has same, then both the variables have the same memory location. If a single value changes means it creates new memory location for that new variable.
# byte: 8 bit(2^8)
# Lexicographical order: Dict method comparison between strings.
# Relational Operator: <,>,<=,>=
# Equality Operator: ==, !=
# Assignment Operator: +=,-=,*=,/=,//=,**=,%=
# Arithmetic Operator: +,-,*,/,%,//,**
# Ternary Operator(Conditional Operator):
# Membership Operators: in, not in
# Operators Chaining: chain combinations of conditions.
# Bitwise Operator: #, & - multiply, | - addition, ~. ^, <<, >>  -  Mostly used in Banking process projects for encryption
# Logical Operator: AND, OR, NOT
# Formatted Strings: %i, %d, %f, %s   --   used at databases while fetching data's
    # %i = for integer
    # %d = for decimals
    # %f = for float
    # %s = for strings
# Iterative Statement: While Loops
